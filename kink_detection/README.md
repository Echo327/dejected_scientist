Problem: Kinks are not welcome.

base idea: So, can we detect them in fits automatically, and determine the fit presenting the least kinks in highly correlated and complex set of fits? Properties like differentials (parametric property) and curvature (geometric property) can be used for this effect. These. can the fit be made to minimise these values in order to get a fit with better form than can be achieved simply by using errors and residuals?

idea: for higher dimensions than 2D, can advances in spline detection etc. be applied to minimise error or correct form while fitting.
